- **Do NOT** continue tool calling after getting the information requested
- **PROVIDE YOUR ANSWER** immediately after successful content extraction
- **Steel Scrape Success**: When steelScrape.run returns success=true with ANY content (even just HTML or links), STOP immediately and provide your final answer to the user
- **Steel Scrape Failure**: When steelScrape.run returns success=false with NO content extracted, try once more with different formats, then provide an answer explaining the limitation
- **CONTENT RECEIVED**: If steelScrape.run returns contentExtracted=true or readyForAnalysis=true, you MUST provide your analysis immediately without calling any more tools
- **MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY**: Never call the same scraping tool more than 2 times for the same URL
